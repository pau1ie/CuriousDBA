I am actually quite excited about what I am working towards. Looking back at my [thinking last year](../automation),
I still have a similar goal. I have changed the way I am approaching it slightly. Most encouraging is that I am closer
to achieving it than I was last year.


## Why am I doing this

It is important to remember the reason that I am doing this work. I want to help the users of the system do their
work in the most effective way possible. This means I should do my best to ensure the system is reliable and performs well.


## Why it is Difficult

It is actually really difficult to keep a system as complicated as this working reliably. Changing a small component
could cause problems we never imagined were possible.


## Why it is Thankless

The users just want to do their jobs. I see my role very much like a utility. The electricity supply to my house is very reliable. I don't
often think about the people who make this happen. I never phone them up and thank them for the work they do when it works.
But if it breaks I will call them and expect them to mend it, and to try and make sure it doesn't stop working again.


## How we Deliver What the Users Want

We already have a number of ways to make sure the system is reliable.

* Change control
  * All changes are recorded so we know what happened and when.
  * All changes are done at a time convenient to the users/business (Where possible)
  * All changes are done to a procedure to make sure 
* Testing
  * All changes are tested so we know what impact they will have on the system.
  * Once a change is released to the production system, it is also tested to make sure it is complete.
* Consistency
  * We do our best to make sure what is tested is what is delivered.

The problem with all this is that it is a lot of effort. The last step is what we are weakest on, and what I am working
on improving. Our test system must be identical to our production system in every possible way. The hardware. The software.
The configuration of the software. The procedure used to release any changes. Again the last step is what we are weakest on
and what I am working on improving.
